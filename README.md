# accessible-components
### Intro
This is a library of commonly used components that follows the accessibility best practices described by w3 in [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices)

### Preface
accessible-components uses [Skeletor](https://github.com/delphic-digital/Skeletor), a directory structure and Gulpfile designed as an easy starting point for front end development of projects. Mainly it was developed for projects at Delphic Digital, but it was designed to be agnostic, so any project is capable of using it. It is designed to give you a quick and organized way to start developing web apps with best practices in mind.
